            Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications that run on the internet. It involves a variety of tasks, including web design, content creation, coding, scripting, server-side configuration, database management, security implementation, and more.

            Web development can be broadly categorized into two main parts:
            <br>
            <br>
            Front-end Development: This involves creating the visible parts of a website that users interact with directly. It includes designing the layout, content, and user interface using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end developers aim to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

            <br>
            Back-end Development: This focuses on the server-side of web development. It involves working on the behind-the-scenes functionalities that power the website, such as server configuration, databases, handling user requests, server scripting, and ensuring the website's functionality and performance. Back-end developers often use languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and frameworks like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
