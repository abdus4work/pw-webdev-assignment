Comments in HTML serve as non-rendering notes or explanations within the code.
we used comment to annotate the HTML to provide information for developers or anyone working the codebase without affecting the page which is rendering in the browser.
In HTML anything between <!-- and --> will be treated as comments and not rendered by the browser.

Example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Assignment-1 Answer</title>
</head>
